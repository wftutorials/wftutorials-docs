##  Pages

Tutorials are separated by pages. Pages are sections in our tutorials and provide a great way to focus your tutorials. Think of your tutorial as a book. Each page as something new and interesting.

Usages of pages

* Hold your tutorial content. You can create a single page tutorial if you like.
* Hold code. You can add code samples in separate pages.
* Separate topics. You can separate your tutorial to make it more consumable.
* Its really up to you.
