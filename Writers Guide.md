# Writers Guide

Writing for wfTutorials I have some short guidelines.

* Focus on code as much as possible. This means non lengthy introductions and historically rants.
* When adding comments to code snippets focus on possible errors, different ways to implement the solution etc. ( You need to look at how wfTutorials is structured to understand this)
* Don't stray from the topic. Don't confuse the reader with versions and alternative routes. Sticky with one way. You can create multiple tutorials on the same topic showing different ways.
* Creating sections if necessary and make each section independent. The reader should not have to unnecessarily following sections in order.
* Have the entire code sample available. Even if it doesn't work. The reader should be able to see the entire code for the project.
* Don't write about learning any new language. Always write about creating something. Every tutorial the user should be able to do something when they are complete. Hello world is the only introduction allowed for any language.
* Never assume the user is a beginner. Instead point the user to different web articles that could provide them with more information. Always assume the user can program in one language and knows the basic of programming.
* Comment code samples as much as possible. Make it ridiculous and redundant if necessary.
* Add pictures of sample output. You can also use comments for this as well.
* If a topic is to complex do not explain it. Instead just show the user how it is done and point them to articles that could further explain the subject matter. Do not waste time on complex topics. The user will figure this out themselves.



Submission

* When submitting your tutorials separate the comments from the main article with lines ( -------- )
