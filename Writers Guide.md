# Writers Guide

Writing for wfTutorials I have some short guidelines.

* Focus on code as much as possible. This means non lengthy introductions and historically rants.
* When adding comments to code snippets focus on possible errors, different ways to implement the solution etc.
* Dont stray from the topic. Don't confuse the reader with versions and alternative routes.
* Creating sections if necessary and make each section independent.
* Have the entire code sample available. Even if it doesn't work. The reader should be able to see the entire code for the project.
* Dont write about learning any new language. Always write about creating something. Every tutorial the user should be able to do something.
* Never assume the user is a beginner. Instead point the user to different web articles that could provide them with more information. Always assume the user can program in one language.
* Comment code samples as much as possible. Make it ridiculous and redunant if necessary.
